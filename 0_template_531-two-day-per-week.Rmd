Enter in your training 1RM (pg.21):

$$
weight * reps * 0.0333 + weight = \texttt{1RM}
$$
Then 

$$
\texttt{1RM} * 0.9 = \texttt{1RM Training Max}
$$
```{r}
c(squat = 185, bench = 210, press = 155, dead = 365)


```

```{r}
data.frame(lift = c("squat", "bench", "dead", "press"),
           weight = c(205, 225, 365, 155),
           reps = c(3, 2, 3, 3)) %>% 
  mutate(one_RM = weight*reps*0.0333 + weight,
          training_max = 0.9*one_RM)
```
